# Big Project 1 IF3170 - Machine Learning 2024/2025

## Description

This repository contains the implementation of machine learning algorithms **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**, **Gaussian Naive Bayes**, and **ID3 (Iterative Dichotomiser 3)** applied to the **UNSW-NB15** dataset. The goal of this project is to provide hands-on experience in applying machine learning algorithms to real-world problems and comparing "from scratch" implementations with scikit-learn's library.

## Repository Structure

- `src/` : This folder contains the source code for the algorithm implementations and experiments.
- `doc/` : This folder contains the report in PDF format, including technical explanations and experimental results.
- `README.md` : This document contains guidelines for understanding and running the project.

## Dataset

The **UNSW-NB15** dataset is a collection of network traffic data, including various types of cyberattacks and normal activities. The dataset can be accessed via the following links:
- [Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/t/ddd18d90f93a47e48f8850b1f1592381)
- [UNSW Research](https://research.unsw.edu.au/projects/unsw-nb15-dataset)

## Key Features

1. **KNN Implementation (from scratch)**:
   - Supports the number of neighbors as a parameter.
   - Supports 3 distance metrics: Euclidean, Manhattan, and Minkowski.

2. **Gaussian Naive Bayes Implementation (from scratch)**.

3. **ID3 Implementation (from scratch)**:
   - Supports numerical data processing as discussed in the lecture material.

4. **Comparison of Implementation Results with scikit-learn Library**:
   - For ID3, `DecisionTreeClassifier` with the parameter `criterion='entropy'` is used.

5. **Model Persistence**:
   - Models can be saved and loaded in various formats such as `.pkl` or `.txt`.
